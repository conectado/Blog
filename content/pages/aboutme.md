Hello! I'm Gabriel Steinberg, I also go by @conectado, but you can call me Gabi too.

I'm a Rust Engineer, Programmer? A guy who yells at the compiler until it does it job.

My topics of interest are Networking and Security but I also loooove math and physics.

My hobbies are TTRPGs, Video Games, Anime and Manga and lately I got into lifting, if you want to talk about that.

I never know what to put in this pages, so yeah here are some useful links if you want to find out more about me:
