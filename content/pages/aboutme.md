Hello! I'm Gabriel Steinberg, I also go by @conectado, but you can call me Gabi if you want.

I'm a Rust Engineer... Programmer? A guy who yells at the compiler until it does it job.

My topics of interest are Networking and Security but I also loooove math and physics.

My hobbies are TTRPGs, Video Games, Anime, and lately I got into lifting.

I never know what to put in these pages, so yeah here are some useful links if you want to find out more about me:
