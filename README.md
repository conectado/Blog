## About

I'm a systems engineer with a focus on networking, security, and performance. I enjoy diving deep into the technical details of how things work under the hood and sharing what I learn along the way.

Currently working on networking infrastructure and VPN technology. When I encounter interesting problems or build cool solutions, I write about them here.

## Topics I Write About

- **Systems Programming** - Rust, C, kernel development
- **Networking** - Packet processing, firewalls, VPNs
- **Performance** - Optimization, profiling, benchmarking
- **Security** - Network security, access control
- **Infrastructure** - Distributed systems, reliability
